Title: SMUA PCWEB3 - Mini Project
Year: 2020
Topic: Pokemon Challenge WAI-Edition - WHO AM I?
Synopsis: In year 20202, there are 807 Pokemon characters. For this project requirement, I have created randomized questions from a mixed-associative array of 52 elements.
Purpose: To train "Catchers" in recognizing Pokemons by identifying them through names and 2D figures.
Development Stage: Early MVP

Features:

1. Generate randomized questions through a single array of data set.
2. The number of questions can be set through user input on index.php - currently available at 5, 10, 15 and 20.
3. Standard 3 multiple choices is provided for each question.
4. Multiple choices are always randomized for each question.
5. "Correct answer" position is always randomized for each set of multiple choices for each question.
6. Each question is always different for each question cycle run. No same question in a question cycle run.

Future Features:

1. 2D figures to be animated.
2. 2D figures to be 3D animated.
3. Medal Board to show case all players registered in Pokemon-Challenge-WAI (Who Am I?) - based on timing and questions attempted.
4. Live challenge with multiple players playing online.
